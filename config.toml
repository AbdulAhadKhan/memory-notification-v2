#   policy_1:  This policy checks for processes that exceed a certain data resident set size (DRS) limit (lower_limit). 
#   If a process exceeds the limit, it is logged as a policy violation.

#   policy_2: This policy checks for processes that exceed a certain DRS limit for a specified amount of time. 
#   If a process exceeds the limit for the specified amount of time, it is logged as a policy violation.

#   policy_3: This policy checks for processes that have been running for a defined amount of time and are below the lower limit.
#   If a process exceeds both the lower and upper limits and returns within a specific time interval, it is noted as a policy violation.

#   policy_4: This policy checks for processes that have been running for a set amount of time and have not exceeded a given lowerÂ limit. 
#   If a process crosses the lower bound and then returns without passing the higher bound within a given period, it is noted as a policy violation.

#   policy_5: The purpose of this policy is to monitor processes that have been active for a specific duration without surpassing a designated lower limit. 
#   In case a process surpasses the lower bound, subsequently surpasses the upper bound, 
#   and then reverts back to operating between the lower and upper limits, it will be flagged as a violation of this policy.
